    "text": "AI generated image\n\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, my husband and I sat at our kitchen table to do what thousands of Canadian families do every year: pick out our next car. We really wanted to go green. We were ready to ditch the gas station forever. But as we weighed the pros and cons, the conversation kept hitting a wall.\n“Look at the map,” my husband said, pulling up a charging app on his phone. “If we want to visit family up north or take a spontaneous weekend trip, we have to plan our whole lives around where the chargers are. With a gas car, we don’t even think about it. The stations are just there — they’re everywhere, and they’re reliable.”\nHe was right. In that moment, the gas car won, not because it was a better machine, but because it felt safer. For us, and for many Canadians, switching to an EV feels like a leap of faith into a network that is still playing catch-up. This is the heart of “Range Anxiety.” It’s not just about the battery; it’s about the fear that the convenience of the past century won’t be matched by the infrastructure of the next.\n\n\n\nWe are currently in a massive transition period. On one hand, the numbers look great. Between 2024 and early 2025, the number of public chargers in Canada jumped by about 24%. Federal programs like the Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program (ZEVIP) are pumping millions into the ground, and as of early 2026, we are seeing chargers pop up in places we never expected.\nBut look closer, and you’ll see the cracks. While you might find dozens of chargers in a trendy downtown Toronto mall, try finding one in a suburban rental neighborhood or a rural corridor in the Prairies. This is the “Infrastructure Gap.” Analysts tell us that we will need hundreds of thousands more chargers to meet our 2035 goals.\nIf we don’t get the placement right, the “predictability” my husband was looking for will remain a luxury. The problem isn’t just about building more — it’s about building smarter.\n\n\n\nIn the past, urban planning was reactive. A city might place a charger where they received the most requests or simply where there was an empty parking lot near a power line. But this “first-come, first-served” approach creates three major problems:\n\nInequity: It favors wealthy areas where people already own EVs and have private garages.\nWaste: We end up with “ghost stations” — expensive chargers in areas where no one actually stops.\nOvercrowding: Popular stations become bottlenecked, leading to those frustrating lines that scare away potential buyers.\n\nTo solve this, we need to stop guessing. As a data science student, I see this as the perfect job for Machine Learning.\n\n\n\nImagine a computer model that acts like a scout, looking at the entire country and saying, “Put a fast charger exactly here, and it will be busy 80% of the time.” This isn’t science fiction; it’s what we can do right now by feeding a model the right “ingredients.”\nTo build a truly reliable network, a model needs to look at four main types of data:\n\n\nWe don’t just drive in straight lines. We stop at grocery stores, parks, and offices. By analyzing traffic flow and “dwell time” (how long a car stays parked in one spot), a model can identify where a charger would be most useful. If people typically spend 40 minutes at a specific shopping center, that’s a prime spot for a Level 2 charger.\n\n\n\nThis is the most important part of the puzzle. Millions of Canadians live in apartments or condos where they can’t just plug in at night. If we only look at where EVs are currently owned, we miss these people. By including census data on housing types, the model can prioritize public chargers for renters, ensuring that living in an apartment isn’t a barrier to going green.\n\n\n\nYou can’t just stick a high-speed charger anywhere. They pull a massive amount of power. By integrating data from utility companies, the model can ensure that new stations are placed where the grid is strong enough to handle them without requiring a multi-million dollar upgrade.\n\n\n\nWe can learn from the chargers we already have. Which ones are always full? Which ones are always broken? By looking at historical usage, the model can predict “hot spots” before they even become a problem.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at a city like Calgary. If planners use the traditional way, they might put all their new chargers near the downtown office towers. But once the 5:00 PM rush ends, those chargers sit empty while people head home to the suburbs.\nIf they introduce ML models into their planning, it might point them to a specific suburban commuter hub or a “cold spot” near a popular community center. This ensures the chargers are working 24/7. It maximizes the “return on investment” for every taxpayer dollar spent. Every kilowatt of energy is going where it’s actually needed.\n\n\n\nWhen we let data lead the way, we do something bigger than just building infrastructure — we build trust.\nIf my husband and I can look at a map and see that there are chargers in the neighbourhoods where we actually shop, and on the rural roads where we actually travel, that “leap of faith” becomes a simple, logical choice.\nThis data-driven approach could aid with our battle with climate issues. It ensures that the transition to clean energy isn’t just for people with six-figure incomes and three-car garages. It’s for the student in a basement suite and the family in a high-rise. It makes the “green” choice accessible to everyone.\nThe transition to electric vehicles is one of the biggest shifts in human history. It is about reimagining how we move. But we can’t build a new world using old tools.\nMachine learning gives us a roadmap. It turns a chaotic infrastructural rollout into a strategic, evidence-based plan. It allows city planners and energy providers to predict and act better.\nMy husband and I haven’t bought that car yet. But seeing how we can use data to turn a “leap of faith” into a “predictable path” gives me a lot of hope. When the network is as reliable as the old gas station down the street, we won’t be sitting at the kitchen table arguing about range. We’ll be sitting in the car, ready for the next trip.\n\n\n\n\nPublic Charging Growth Data: Electric Autonomy Canada — 2025 EV Charging Network Report\nFederal Funding & Targets: Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) — Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program (ZEVIP)\nNational Infrastructure Forecasts: NRCan/Dunsky — Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure for Canada (2025–2040 Forecast)\nGlobal Trends & Utilization Research: International Energy Agency (IEA) — Global EV Outlook 2025\nConsumer Barriers & Industry Insights: Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association (CVMA) — Closing the EV Charging Gap\nRegional Progress (Case Study Ref): Government of British Columbia — 2024 Zero-Emission Vehicle Update"
